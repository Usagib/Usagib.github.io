The New York Times has been a leader in experimenting with the inclusion of multimedia content in traditional stories. That creates all kinds of interesting position questions.

This project consists of making a clone of a New York Times article page. using familiar concepts such as:

1. Embedding images
2. Working with forms (buttons in this case)
3. Floats and positioning
4. The box model
